## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)
- A tolerance for neon colors (not medically required but highly recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-chat.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```
   cd ai-chat
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```
   npm install
   ```
   This will install all necessary packages, including React, axios, Framer Motion, tsParticles, and more.

4. **Start the Development Server**

   ```
   npm start
   ```

5. **Open the App**

   Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the magic happen.

## Usage

### Select an AI Model

Choose from the dropdown menu of available models. If you're feeling nostalgic, stick with tinyllama-1.1b. We won't judge.

### Send a Message

Type your message into the input field at the bottom. Feeling adventurous? Press Enter or click the glowing SEND button.

### Experience the Glow

Watch as your messages and the AI's responses illuminate the screen with animated flair. Try not to get too mesmerized.

### Enjoy Interactivity

Hover over buttons and elements to see interactive animations. It's like the app knows you like attention.

## Customization

### Particle Background

Want to tweak the animated background? Modify the particle settings in the Particles component within `App.tsx`:

```
<Particles
  id="tsparticles"
  init={particlesInit}
  options={{
    // Customize particle options here
  }}
  className="absolute inset-0 z-0"
/>
```

### Themes and Styling

Customize colors, fonts, and more by modifying the Tailwind CSS configuration in `tailwind.config.js`:

```
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        neonPink: '#fe019a',
        neonBlue: '#00ffff',
        // Add your custom colors here
      },
      // ...other configurations
    },
  },
};
```

## Troubleshooting


### tsParticles Version Mismatch

If you encounter an error like:

```
The tsParticles version is different from the loaded plugins version. Engine version: X.X.X. Plugins version: Y.Y.Y.
```

**Solution**:

1. **Ensure All tsParticles Packages Are the Same Version**

   Install matching versions:

   ```

   npm install tsparticles@latest
   npm install react-tsparticles@latest
   ```

2. **Clean Install**

   Delete `node_modules` and lock files:

   ```
   rm -rf node_modules
   rm package-lock.json
   ```

   Then reinstall:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Other Issues

- **Blank Screen**: Check the console for errors and ensure all dependencies are installed.
- **Animations Not Working**: Make sure you have the latest versions of framer-motion and react-tsparticles.

## Future Enhancements

Just when you thought this app couldn't get any cooler, here's what's on the horizon:
- **Emojis and Reactions**: Because sometimes a üëç says more than words.
- **Sound Effects**: Subtle audio cues for sending and receiving messages.
- **Multilingual Support**: Chat in Klingon? We're on it.
- **Message Encryption**: For those top-secret conversations about buying more neon lights.
